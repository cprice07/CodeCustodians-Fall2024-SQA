# Project Activity Report

## Part A - Corah Price

### 1. Activities Done
   - **Research and Planning**: Conducted background research on secure coding practices and identified potential vulnerabilities in Python applications.
   - **Implementation of Pre-Commit Hook**: Developed a `pre-commit` Git hook to automate security checks using the `bandit` tool, ensuring that all Python files are scanned for vulnerabilities before being committed.
   - **Testing**: Tested the hook on various Python files to validate its effectiveness in identifying security weaknesses. Adjusted configurations based on initial results.
   - **Created README File**: Created a README file that outlines project activities, setup instructions, and example usage to ensure that all team members can easily understand and utilize the project.

### 2. Lessons Learned
   - **Importance of Automation**: Automating security checks significantly reduced the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities into the codebase. It highlighted the value of integrating security practices into the development workflow.
   - **Tool Limitations**: Encountered limitations with the `bandit` tool, such as false positives. This experience emphasized the need for manual review processes in conjunction with automated tools to ensure a comprehensive security strategy.
